 # Exercise 0 (5P)

1) Clone this repository to your local machine
2) Edit this file (README.md) and write a nice little poem below these instructions.
3) Commit your changes and push them to github.


Git is such a mysterious tool,
so many commands and options, I am an ignorant fool.

I add. I commit. I merge, pull and push,
everything else turns my mind to mush.

I use aliases that make me feel 1337,
but when I dance with this devil, I have two left feet.

Panic! Merge conflict! Lost in a diff avalanche!
My detached head is left swinging from a branch.


Enough is enough! This will not do.
I will learn the ways of the repo. I will master Git-Fu!
